# Ansible Secure Web Application Deployment

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a web application using **Ansible**, while following **security best practices** such as **Ansible Vault for secret management** and **SSH key authentication**.

The environment consists of an **Ansible control node** and a **managed client node** where the application is deployed.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

This lab demonstrates how to:

- Automate application deployment using **Ansible**
- Secure sensitive information using **Ansible Vault**
- Use **SSH key-based authentication**
- Structure an Ansible project following best practices
- Deploy infrastructure in a **repeatable and automated way**

## 🔐 Secret Management with Ansible Vault

Sensitive variables (like admin passwords) are stored inside a **vault-encrypted file**.

### Encrypt the vault file

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt files/secrets/credentials.vault
````

### Edit encrypted secrets

```bash
ansible-vault edit files/secrets/credentials.vault
```

### Load secrets in the playbook

```yaml
vars_files:
  - files/secrets/credentials.vault
```

---

## 🔑 SSH Key Authentication

Generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Copy the public key to the managed node:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Disable host key checking in the inventory:

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Playbook

Execute the deployment:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml deploy.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

You will be prompted to enter:

* your **sudo password**
* your **vault password**

---

## ✅ Verification

After execution, verify:

* The playbook finished successfully
* The container is running on the client node
* The web application is accessible

Example:

```bash
docker ps
```
